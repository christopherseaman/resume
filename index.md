# About me

Innovative Data Science & Growth leader with a rich two-decade journey. My passion lies in transforming raw data into strategic decisions, solving complex challenges, and propelling business success through technology. A collaborative leader known for inspiring teams to craft impactful solutions that bridge the gap between data-driven insights and tangible results.

Driven by the ideals of DevOps, I have fostered thriving team cultures by cultivating an environment of continuous improvement, where collaboration and shared ownership flourish. One standout example was an early bundling test for Jira: it quadrupled signups but had fewer conversions! In light of this surprising ‚Äúfailure‚Äù, the team and stakeholders embraced transparent communication and iterative problem solving. That allowed us to devise new experiments to probe our assumptions, eventually resulting in a clear win and the bundling strategy still offered today.

# Signature achievements

- **Transforming vision into reality**: Orchestrated multi-year roadmaps, aligning technical strategy with business objectives. Successfully executed projects using Agile, allowing predictable delivery timelines while upholding SLAs.
- **Building high-performing teams**: Mentored data science teams of up to 11, fostering ideals of innovation and continuous learning. Additional team expertise in current tools & practices resulted in faster releases and improved quality.
- **Driving a culture of measurability**: Led cultural transformation towards data-informed decision-making across organizations. Resulted in processes with feature releases measured against predetermined success criteria using standardized metrics.
